    /*
Each test case begins with a line containing three integers n, k, and h . A piece of bread is guaranteed to be a convex
polygon of n vertices. Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi ( 0$ \le$xi, yi$ \le$ 1,000)
representing the Cartesian coordinates of the ith vertex. The vertices are numbered in counterclockwise order. The test
case n = 0, k = 0, h = 0 terminates the input.
